# updraft-appcenter-migration-tool
The App Center Migration Tool is a command-line interface (CLI) designed to help App Center organizations seamlessly migrate their apps and releases to [Updraft](https://getupdraft.com)  . This tool streamlines the migration process, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition from Microsoft App Center to the Updraft app distribution platform.

## Precondition
Before using the migration tool, please ensure the following:

âœ… You are registered with Updraft

âœ… Youâ€™ve created your projects and apps in Updraft

ðŸ”¹ Updraft Project Hierarchy:
Updraft organizes apps using a **project-based hierarchy**:

- Each **project** can include multiple **apps**
- Apps can belong to **different operating systems** (iOS, Android, Windows)
- Apps can be grouped by **deployment environments** (e.g., staging, QA, production)

This structure helps you manage complex delivery pipelines and keep platform- and environment-specific builds cleanly organized within a single project.

âœ… You have your Microsoft App Center API key

âœ… You have your Updraft API key

âœ… You have your App Keys from Updraft

## ðŸš€ Releases: From App Center to Updraft

In **Microsoft App Center**, a *release* refers to a distributed app version.

In **Updraft**, this is called a **build**, and distribution is handled through creating a **release**. So builds can be uploaded first, but there is no need to distribute it already at the same time.

### Here's how it works in Updraft:

1. A **build version** is uploaded or migrated to your app in Updraft.
2. You create a **release** by selecting:
   - The **app**
   - The **deployment environment**
   - The **build version**
   - Target **distribution groups** or specific **tester email addresses**
3. After configuration, you **send** the release.
4. Testers receive an **email notification** with an **installation link** to access the release.

### ðŸ“¦ Distribution Options:

- **Public link**: anyone with the link can install
- **Managed release**: only specified testers or groups receive the release
- **Managed permission groups**: you can create permission groups, assign permission groups to projects and set the user-role each group

This allows for structured, controlled, and trackable app distributionâ€”perfect for beta testing, QA, or internal deployments.

# Usage

```bash
./bin/appcenter-migration-tool --help
```

## Login

```bash
./bin/appcenter-migration-tool login appcenter --appcenterToken <token>
```

**NOTE: app center user API token with Full Access required**
```bash
./bin/appcenter-migration-tool apps list-org-apps --organizationName <organization-name>
```

Migrate the specified app from App Center to existing app in Updraft. This will migrate all app releases from App Center
to Updraft. Each app release in App Center will correspond to app build in Updraft app. Command parameters:
- `profileName`
    - App Center app name for migration to an Updraft
    - **IMPORTANT** - app name, not app display name - you can find app name by using previous two commands for listing apps
- `owner` - App Center application owner name
- `updraftAppKey` - Your Updraft app key/token. You find it in 'Edit App'.
- `updraftApiKey` - Your Updraft api key/token. You find it in 'Profile > Tokens'.
- `ignoreDisabled` - Optional parameter. If set to true, the tool will ignore disabled releases in App Center. Default value is false.

```bash
./bin/appcenter-migration-tool apps migrate-profile --profileName="<app-name>" --owner="<owner-name>" --updraftAppKey="<app-key>" --updraftApiKey="<api-key>"
```

## Organizations

```bash
./bin/appcenter-migration-tool organizations list-appcenter-orgs
```

## Distribution Groups
